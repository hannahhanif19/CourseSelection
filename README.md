# LWHS Course Selection Page
Made by Abraham Corea Diaz and Hannah Hanif
This is a course selection page to give information and opportunities of courses at LWHS. Not only does the page have all (except all the electives) course descriptions with a syllabus or example student works, but it also has a plan your schedule section, which allows Lick students to visually plan their schedule for the following year. Our initial goal was to have a sign up and log in database, but we did not have time to complete it nor were we able to figure out how to send the planned schedule chart straight to Dr. Nguyen for course sign ups.
