      <h1>Overview and Goal</h1>
      <p>The mathematics department strives to empower students to interact with mathematics so they can experience the power and beauty of the subject. LWHS teaches students to approach math as a way of thinking, with the focus on inquiry, sense making, reasoning, and application. In each class, students have the opportunity to collaborate, persist, and seek multiple approaches in order to become more flexible and strategic problem solvers. Students develop a learning mindset by reflecting on mistakes and viewing them as opportunities for growth. With this mindset, students know that they can learn any mathematics they may need to achieve their goals in life. </p>

      <h1>Algebra 1</h1>
      <p>While many incoming 9th graders have taken a beginning algebra course in middle school, many students need to broaden and deepen their understanding of elementary algebra in order to have the tools to be successful in the courses that follow. Topics include: ratios, simplification and factoring of various kinds of variable expressions, solutions to linear/quadratic equations and linear inequalities/systems, graphing of two variable linear equations and inequalities, and mathematical modeling of real world situations. The course also introduces mathematical thinking skills that enable students to develop mastery based on reasoning and understanding of concepts, rather than memorization of rules and formulas.<br></br>Students who successfully complete this course move on to Inductive Geometry or Deductive Geometry with department recommendation.<br></br>
      <b>This is a year-long course.</b></p>

      <h1>Inductive Geometry</h1>
      <p>The core focus of this course is to develop inductive and deductive reasoning skills. Students develop these skills by investigating geometric properties of lines, angles, similar and congruent polygons, circles, transformations, right triangle trigonometry, area, and volume. Students explore these properties through collaborative coursework and use of tools such as the compass, straightedge, and technology. Through these explorations, students develop ways to justify geometric properties. Students will become more confident and effective problem solvers through the practice of the schoolwide habits of mind and mathematical thinking skills. An extensive review of Algebra 1 topics is also integrated throughout the curriculum.<br></br>Students who successfully complete this course move on to Algebra 2 or Algebra 2 Accelerated with department recommendation.<br></br>Prerequisite: Algebra 1 at LWHS or department recommendation.<br></br><b>This is a year long course.</b></p>

      <h1>Deductive Geometry</h1>
      <p>This course is a more traditional geometry course, following the deductive approach and formal study of geometric concepts pioneered by Euclid. It benefits students who enjoy mathematical reasoning and have demonstrated a deep understanding of elementary algebra. Beginning with an introduction to logic, students prove the classical theorems of Euclidean Geometry and apply these ideas to challenging problems. Computers and manipulatives are used to explore and demonstrate geometric concepts, constructions, and transformations. Other topics include right triangle trigonometry and a brief overview of non Euclidean Geometry.<br></br>Students who successfully complete this course move on to Algebra 2 or Algebra 2 Accelerated with department recommendation.<br></br>Prerequisites: Algebra 1 and department recommendation.<br></br>
