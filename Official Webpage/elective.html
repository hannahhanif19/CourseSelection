      <h1>English Electives</h1>
        <div class="folder" data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The four year English curriculum provides students with the skills and habits of mind to read, write, and speak confidently and competently about a broad range of texts. Each year, students hone their analytical skills by drawing on class discussions and independent close readings to craft thoughtful, subtle responses to literature from around the world. All English classes include frequent writing assignments in various genres that encourage students to develop an authentic voice, as well as critical and creative independent thinking. A focus on the writing process and revision skills is integral to every course. Classes are discussion and activity oriented, requiring students to become respectful of multiple perspectives, compassionate for others, and confident in expressing their ideas. All English courses are UC eligible.</p>

      <div class="folder" data-role="collapsible">
      <h1>Creative Writing: Memoir, the Art of the Personal Story</h1>
      <p>Something we do frequently and in many different forms (for college essays, when we enter new environments and new relationships, on job and fellowship applications) is tell people about who we are and what we care about. It seems like it should be easy, but it’s actually fairly complex to figure out what it means to capture a personal story that is relevant and significant to others as well as to ourselves. In order to learn how to tell our own stories and to talk about what’s most important to us and why, we will explore what it means to break down some of the preconceived notions and definitions (in terms of form and content) that seem to prescribe what it means to tell or write a personal narrative. The main tasks will be (1) to read many different types and forms of memoirs; (2) write your own personal memoirs implementing new techniques and forms; (3) workshop, critique, revise, and help others do so, and (4) keep a journal documenting your class work and your exercises. We can’t understand or empathize with others until we understand ourselves, and this course will provide an entry into doing both. Course texts will include writing by Joan Didion, Ta Nehisi Coates, Eula Biss, Natalia Ginzburg, Roxane Gay, Toni Morrison, Richard Rodriguez, David Sedaris, and many others.</p>

      <p>The class is open to 11th and 12th grade students and does not count toward the four year English course requirement.</p>

        <h1>Journalism PPP</h1>
      <p>The Journalism class offers an opportunity for students to work in a professional setting as a member of the Fourth Estate, the press, the vital investigative branch of democracy. Students will plan, write, edit, and design the LWHS student print publication, the <i>Paper Tiger</i>, and the <a href="http://www.lwhspapertiger.org/">online version</a>. Students will write in depth news stories, features, profiles, reviews, and editorials, and they must write for all sections of the paper—from news, sports, arts, leisure and op ed. To get the story, students will work in the field and in the newsroom researching, writing, discussing, and dissecting. The course will facilitate building skills around how to think critically, write strategies, and study the design and impact of rhetorical techniques. Students will consider both the ethics of journalism and the future of different news media. Students must learn Adobe InDesign CC to publish the paper.</p>
      <p>PPP requirements for the course will be satisfied by students identifying, investigating, and writing one long-form feature that highlights the work of a Bay Area community organization or a vital community issue. This feature must require research, investigation, and interviews off campus. The article will be published in the <i>Paper Tiger</i> and possibly in an external news outlet. In addition, students must write one op ed and submit it for consideration, for example, to Youth Radio or KQED Perspectives.</p>
      <p>The course is open to <b>sophomores, juniors, and seniors</b>. Students may enroll in Journalism multiple times. The instructor’s signature is required on the course signup sheet. Current <i>Paper Tiger</i> editors (and students selected as editors for the 2017–18 school year) will be given priority in scheduling, regardless of grade level. This policy is meant to maintain continuity for the newspaper staff. Add/Drop at the semester by permission of instructor only.<br></br>

      <h1>Independent Studies</h1>
        <div class="folder" data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Juniors and seniors may do semester-long independent studies to investigate a topic in a discipline not offered at LWHS (e.g. economics) or a topic not covered in-depth in the curriculum (e.g. Native American history). Students must submit a detailed proposal to apply for an independent study that includes: a pointed question that the student will investigate, a syllabus detailing what materials the student will explore, and a description of the proposed final product. While a faculty member must supervise an independent study, the work of planning and executing the independent study is the responsibility of the student. Aside from shops-based independent studies that may require supervision, students should expect to check in with their supervising teacher roughly once a rotation. In short, independent studies should be independent. The supervising teacher, the appropriate Department Chair, and the Assistant Head of School must review and sign the proposal.</p>
        <p>Students may have only one independent study per semester, and it may not count as one of a student’s six required courses. Teachers may supervise only one independent study per semester. All independent studies are graded pass/fail.</p>

        <h1>Circuits and Electronics: Analog and Digital</h1>
        <p>This course focuses on the basic skills to design and build with both linear analog and programmable digital circuits. The first of two projects delves into amplifying audio (from a personal music device or musical instrument), as well as sculpting audio frequencies. Students learn to improve the sound of their amplified audio through research on material thickness, resonance, enclosure shapes as well as other factors. The second project focuses on programming a microcontroller for basic digital audio input, output, and audio analysis. After performing a number of basic experiments, students will create a digitally controlled add on for their amplifier—this can be an audio visualizer, an interactive electronic instrument, or an audio sample player.</p>

        <h1>Circuits and Electronics: Device Invention</h1>
        <p>The main goal of this course is to make students feel more comfortable and nimble with the process of designing and creating interactive electronic devices. Throughout this course, we will reference this central question: What are the long term implications of an increasingly automated and connected world? The three themed projects created in this course include: Wireless Device Communication (WiFi, Bluetooth, Cellular, RF), Environmental Sensor Data Collection and Visualization, and Solar Powered Devices. Refined craftsmanship is balanced with rapid prototyping as we build circuits, mechanics, code, and enclosures for a variety of creative machines. Some projects are collaborative and require students to practice the collective art of teamwork, inclusion, and compromise. The instructor will act as a curator/facilitator guiding students through specific themes—at times learning with them—through experiments, lectures, guests, and online documentation.</p>
        <p>The course offers more project freedom than the Analog and Digital course, with the expectation for each student to take ownership of the learning process by seeking answers from any and all sources including: provided documentation, peers, online resources, and the instructor. Finally, it’s important to put everything we do in context by asking “why?” and “for whom?” do we do these projects.</p>

      <h1>Visual Arts</h1>
        <div class="folder" data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The visual arts department nurtures perception, thinking and expression. According to Spanish philosopher, Jose Ortega y Gasset, “Art is creation, renewal, and freedom.” Zen master, D.T. Suzuki asserts that it rises “… from the isness of things, unhampered by senses and intellect.” The department believes that it empowers the discovery of creative promise within.</p>
        <p>Visual arts faculty encourage students to explore their imagination, tap their experience and knowledge about the world, and trust their unique vision without fear of failure. We stress visual literacy, conceptual thinking, experimentation, craftsmanship, and commitment. LWHS students will be asked to explore, take risks, persevere, and deepen their visual perceptions honestly, reflectively, and carefully. The intention is to inspire them to be curious, creative, and courageous, but also disciplined and attentive. Through the development of their visual literacy, LWHS students will become more confident in the uniqueness of their vision.</p>
        <p>Teacher artists in the visual arts department nurture respect for cultural heritage, as well as for contemporary art. The courses provide more than art foundations; they instill life skills that will serve students beyond the classroom. Through varied course offerings, students engage in asking essential questions about the visual world, develop skills in making important artwork, and use artists habits of mind in their inquiry and process. Through engagement in the program, students will become active contributors to a culture that values art. The hope is that through effort, perseverance, and inquiry, students will achieve a deeper visual understanding of their world and that they will be inspired to create in the future.</p>

        <h1>Advanced Architectural Design</h1>
        <p>A continuation and extension of the introductory Architectural Design class, the Advanced Architectural Design course is designed to make connections with the real world. While students still explore the value of creativity and originality of their designs, a great emphasis is placed on learning about socially responsible and sustainable architecture. Additionally, students study the technological, ecological, and urban aspects of skyscrapers because they have fundamentally transformed cities. No other form of construction can replace them as a response to the exponentially increasing need for space. In order to deepen their sense of architectural composition while developing a personal style students work on individual and group projects. Their studio work is supplemented with slides and film presentations that address issues in contemporary architecture. Class activities include oral and written critiques in response to student and professional work, visits to exhibits and design studios, and presentations by local professionals.</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Juniors and seniors may serve for a semester as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in a class that they have previously taken with success. TA’s must be attached to a specific section of a class, are expected to attend all class meetings, and are to be included in the class roll. Additionally, they should meet once a rotation outside of class with their supervising faculty member. Alternatively, in the case of science, TA’s who assist with lab preparation may meet regularly with a faculty member during a shared free block.</p>
        <p>All TA’s receive academic credit, and therefore their work should not be restricted to such tasks as photocopying and filing. Rather, they should be exposed to what it means to be a teacher through meaningful activities, such as lesson planning, testing labs, and creating evaluations; in other words, it is expected that all TA’s will have the opportunity to teach. Additionally, all TA’s are expected to produce a thoughtful reflection of their work (e.g. a portfolio, write-up of a new lab design, or conference presentation).</p>
        <p>Students may hold only one TA position per semester, and it may not count as one of a student’s six required courses. Teachers may have only one TA per class, and all TA’s are graded pass/fail.</p>

        <p>This course will have students apply the combined skills learned in previous technical arts classes with new skills focused on leadership. The faculty member will act as a mentor and coach, introducing material so that the student leader can better understand cultural competency, equitable pedagogical practices, and their impact on the learning environment. These learning strategies will then be applied and focus on four main areas on a daily basis—teaching, community, machine maintenance/class prep, and reflection.</p>
        <p>Prerequisites: Design & Technology along with one semester of the class being a teaching assistant.</p>
        <p>Note: This class does not fulfill the technical arts graduation requirement.</p>
        <p><b>This semester-long course offered in the Fall and Spring fulfills the Public Purpose Program requirement for juniors and seniors.</b></p>
