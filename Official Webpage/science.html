      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Science empowers students to share in the joy of comprehending the natural world. Science is a way of thinking, a process—much more than a collection of facts. Students discover content through inquiry, curiosity, and exploration. Students will ask questions, design experiments, and analyze data. They will also learn to look at concepts from multiple perspectives and relate science to everyday experiences. Classes offer a mix of discussions, group work, lab experiments, lectures, and projects. Examples, analogies, and lab experiments help students discover and apply concepts. The learning environment is collaborative, enriched by varied learning styles and life experiences. Students also consider the political, ethical, and social dimensions of the subject matter. Students take Biology in the 9th grade and Chemistry in the 10th grade. In the 11th and 12th grades, students can choose among the elective offerings. We encourage students to make a four year plan and discuss their choices and goals with teachers and advisors.</p>

      <p>*Please note that all courses listed are in order of <b>availabilty to the advancing grade levels.</b></p>

      <h1>Physics</h1>
      <p>Physics is a symphony of elegance and simplification. A surprisingly few “laws” or principles successfully describe phenomena ranging from the everyday to the exotic, from the microscopic to cosmic realms. Students are encouraged to question their prior experiences and understandings, and build a robust framework with which to view the universe. Labs and demonstrations provide experimental data, sometimes leading to new and surprising revelations. Because some principles are intimately expressed as mathematical relationships, students will deepen their understanding by applying equations to challenging problems. Students in this course should gain an insightful and intuitive understanding of the principles of physics, supported by readings in historical development and implications. Students will also develop skills in visualization and modeling of quantitative data.
