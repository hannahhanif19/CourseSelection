      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The history department at LWHS provides students with a global perspective on how the past has shaped the present. Paying attention to the political, economic, religious, and social forces that have influenced the modern age, students learn through writing, research, document analysis, projects, discussions, and other class activities. The department is committed to teaching critical thinking, stimulating intellectual curiosity, and examining multiple perspectives. History faculty collaborates with the school library in order to keep pace with contemporary research methods.<br></br>The three year curriculum begins with World History in the sophomore year and continues with U.S. History in the junior year. The senior seminar classes are a culmination of those two years of survey coursework. They are intended to offer students an array of topic options in both Modern World and U.S. History, inspired by teacher interest, that foster a semester long intensive study. Despite differing content, the senior courses are united in the common skills taught, practiced, and assessed.<br></br>*Please note that all courses are listed in order of <b>availabilty to the advancing grade levels.</b></p>

      <h1>Modern World History</h1>
      <p>This required 10th grade course is a survey study of World History from the 16th through the 21st centuries. In the fall semester, students examine the development of the early modern world through the lenses of identity, membership, and worldview. In turn they investigate the ways in which worldview shaped global interactions. Students will regularly be asked to make connections between these interactions in history and look at long term impacts. The spring semester focuses on the modern era, in particular the varied effects of the social, economic, and political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout the year long survey, emphasis is placed on teaching and practicing the skills of historians, including critical reading, research skills, source analysis, daily class discussion, and the elements and art of writing the historical essay.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern U.S. History Seminar: Constructions of Whiteness</h1>
      <p>In the course of human history the emergence of race as a core identifier is fairly recent. In the U.S., the boundaries of racial categories have been more fluid than our racial discourse often suggests. This class will focus on the development of "white" as a racial and cultural identity in contrast to the long-held idea that whiteness is neutral or devoid of race. We will begin with an historical analysis of the global origins of whiteness, as well as its porous yet policed boundaries within the U.S. that allowed some groups entrance while denying others. Guiding questions include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>How have the boundaries of whiteness been protected and for what purpose?</li>
        <li>How were Irish, Poles, Italians, and Jews able to become white after initially being denied?</li>
        <li>How have Mexicans, Middle Easterners, Asians, Native Americans, and light skinned African Americans attempted to gain access to whiteness and what has determined the outcomes?</li>
        <li>What has whiteness provided for those who attained it and what has been lost in the process of whitening?</li>
      </ul>
      This course will also explore modern characteristics of whiteness. How is whiteness defined and used in the U.S. today? In what ways does whiteness exist beyond skin color? This class will ask students to examine modern political trends, pop culture, and their personal relationship to whiteness.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar: Bearing Witness, Holocaust & Genocides</h1>
      <p>After World War II, the world grappled with the atrocities of the Holocaust. Individuals, nations and international organizations vowed that such hateful, targeted killing of a group of people would never again happen. However, the Holocaust was neither the first nor the last of its kind. The 20th century is often referred to as “the century of genocide,” and we are all left wondering how there have been such horrors as the Cambodian, Rwandan, and Bosnian genocides. In this semester-long seminar, we will explore essential questions critical to understanding genocidal studies:
      <ul>
        <li>What is genocide?</li>
        <li>How are such events possible?</li>
        <li>What are signs of genocide?</li>
        <li>Who are the victims, the perpetrators and the bystanders?</li>
        <li>What is our obligation as individuals and nations when confronted with such horrors?</li>
        <li>How do our own choices impact the safety of others?</li>
        <li>How might future events be prevented?</li>
        <li>How do nations and people cope with and bear witness to the horrors of such human behavior?</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar: Cultural Encounters and Anxieties in Modern Latin America</h1>
      <p>This course examines the ethnic, racial, gender, and economic realities of Latin America. It considers how cultural encounters have manifested themselves in the modern popular culture, politics and economics of the region. Guiding questions include:
      <ul>
        <li>Why are there large German, Italian, and Jewish communities scattered around South America?</li>
        <li>What role does Tango play in the political life of Argentina?</li>
        <li>How is food reflective of cultural politics in Peru?</li>
        <li>Why do major Latin stars like Shakira and Salma Hayek have Arabic names?</li>
      </ul>
      Students will examine the impact of immigration, the emergence of geographic ethnic and cultural enclaves, and the constant reformulation of identities in Latin America. In particular, the course will consider the anxieties that inform the borrowing, appropriation, and reformulation of cultural and intellectual movements from other parts of the globe.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar: Revolutionary Thinking, an Introduction to Philosophy</h1>
      <p>Black lives matter. The Occupy movement. ISIS attacks on Charlie Hebdo. How do we make sense of the events of our times? What beliefs about the world drive these actions? How might these events compel us to question our own beliefs? In this course, we will explore moments in modern history in which large scale and often rapid change has led to revolutionary thinking, challenging dominant narratives to create new ways of thinking about self and society. We will spend time with thinkers like Plato, John Locke, Henry Thoreau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Mohandas Gandhi, Frantz Fanon, Martin Luther King Jr., Martha Nussbaum, and Peter Singer. After gaining historical perspective, we will develop philosophical approaches to the present and future. Along the way, we will build skills in reasoning and philosophical discourse, in order to engage constructively around questions such as:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Who am I?</b>—What does it mean to be human? How might technology and A.I. change our understanding of this question? How do ideas about identifiers such as gender, race, class, and religion shift over time?</li>
        <li><b>What is there?</b>—What are the grand narratives of truth and reality, how have they been challenged, and what are the consequences of their dismantling?</li>
        <li><b>What should I do?</b>—How do conceptions of right and wrong shift over time and across cultures? How should we face injustice? </li>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar: The Cold War</h1>
      <p>This course will delve into the fascinating, horrifying, and complex history of the Cold War. Focusing primarily on the time period from the 1940s to the 1980s, the course will cover topics such as the superpower conflict between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., the spiraling arms and space races, the Cold War as it impacted the developing world, the global implications of the Cold War, and the impact of the Cold War on culture and society. The readings and class activities are structured to provide each student the opportunity to explore differing and often contradictory interpretations of history and international politics.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar PPP: Bearing Witness: Genocide and its Aftermath</h1>
      <p>After World War II, the world grappled with the atrocities of the Holocaust.

However, the Holocaust was neither the first nor the last of its kind.

      At it’s core, the course is a study in human behavior and interpretations and understandings of “human nature,” group membership, and obligation. Students will focus on historical and modern case studies of genocide to examine how individuals, nations, and communities choose to confront and remember (or not) atrocities in their aftermath. The course will work in tandem very well with the material offered in English 4 Honors PPP: Bearing Witness: Writers and Artists Respond to Genocide offered through the English department, and students are encouraged to participate in both courses if their schedules permit. Part of the student experience in the course will include some out of classroom experiences that will occur beyond the regular school schedule.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern U.S. History Seminar PPP: America in the 1960s</h1>
       <p>This course will examine the dramatic and often turbulent history of the U.S. in the 1960s. From the optimism of the Kennedy years to the upheavals, divisions, and frustrations that marked the decade, the course will analyze a series of events and movements that stirred passions during the sixties and influenced the development of the U.S. as we know it today. The class will consider social, political, and cultural forces that shaped and defined the era and will study such topics as: the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, the Vietnam War, the rise of the Counterculture, the New Frontier & Great Society, the modern women’s movement, the New Left and the emerging conservative philosophies that formed largely in response to the liberalism of the time. The readings and class activities are structured to provide each student with the opportunity to explore differing and often contradictory interpretations of history and politics.</p>
      <p>This course seeks to connect content with real world experiences in the larger community and leverage the central role of San Francisco and the Bay Area to social activism and cultural change.

      <h1>Modern U.S. History Seminar PPP: Define American, an Exploration of Immigration</h1>
      <p>The U.S. is often described as the land of opportunity, freedom, and equality. However, at its core the U.S. is a nation of immigrants whose experiences of identity and belonging have varied throughout the history of this nation. Some have been welcomed and accepted while others have been treated as the ‘other.’ The rights and promises of the U.S. have not applied equally to all who have made the U.S. their home. Yet, each year thousands of people come to the U.S. for their share of the American dream. In this semester long seminar, we will explore the legal and political periods of immigration, while focusing on the story of those who chose to immigrate to the U.S. We will attempt to understand and explain what it means to be an American, and to explore how our own story and experiences shape our understanding of belonging in the U.S. We will look into the push and pull factors that bring people to the U.S. and try to understand how they are treated once they arrive. We will analyze past and present immigration policies and debate how, when, and why these policies have changed over time.<br></br>

      <h1>Modern U.S. History Seminar PPP: The U.S. and the Middle East</h1>
      <p>The histories of the U.S. and the Middle East have been inextricably intertwined for at least a century. Middle Eastern oil has been integral to America’s political, economic, and cultural development since the early 1900s, and the political history of the region has been at the center of American foreign policy since at least the 1940s. This course examines the complexity of U.S./Middle Eastern relations through an exploration of the issues that have defined this relationship. Oil, the Arab/Israeli conflict, the Cold War, terrorism, Islamophobia, and more recently, the Arab Spring, are among the many issues that students will explore. Additionally, students will undertake both original research projects and more action oriented work that seeks to illuminate the broader LWHS community about the structures and ideologies that underlie U.S./Middle Eastern relations. <br></br>

      <h1>Modern World History Seminar PPP: Patterns in Urbanization</h1>
      <p>Today over 54 percent of the world’s population are living in cities. Since their emergence after the Agricultural Revolution urban centers have produced remarkable human achievements as well as intense conflict. This course will examine various urban settings both in the U.S. and globally to understand the complex dynamics driving urban growth and its impacts. Guiding questions will include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Why is urbanization accelerating?</li>
        <li>What are the environmental and social impacts of this acceleration?</li>
        <li>How different are urban and rural communities really?</li>
        <li>How do real and perceived differences shape sociopolitical culture?</li>
        <li>How do urban centers distribute scarce resources and deal with conflict?</li>
        <li>What do patterns in urban development reveal about the nature of power?</li>

      <h1>Modern World Seminar PPP: The InterWar Years</h1>
      <p>The years 1919‑1939 have been labeled the “Twenty Years Crisis”, bookended by two major and modern world wars. In the Western world, countries struggled to recover from the disastrous Great War while non-western regions struggle under the yoke of imperialism. These years simultaneously gave rise to nationalist movements that advocated for self-determination and independence for some as well as fascist aggression and colonization for others. This course will explores the following themes:
      <ul>
        <li>In the years between the wars, in what ways did concepts about racial and national identity change?</li>
        <li>Self-determination for whom?</li>
        <li>How did national boundaries shift?</li>
        <li>What inspired new strains of political conservatism in both the Western and Eastern world?</li>
        <li>How have modern societies grappled (or not) with their countries’ actions and history in these years?</li>
      </ul>
      The structure of the course will be based on fewer units to facilitate a deep study of the historic trends and modern implications, and varied unit assessments to allow for student freedom in demonstrating their knowledge and learning.<br></br>
