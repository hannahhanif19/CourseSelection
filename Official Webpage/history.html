      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The history department at LWHS provides students with a global perspective on how the past has shaped the present. Paying attention to the political, economic, religious, and social forces that have influenced the modern age, students learn through writing, research, document analysis, projects, discussions, and other class activities. The department is committed to teaching critical thinking, stimulating intellectual curiosity, and examining multiple perspectives. History faculty collaborates with the school library in order to keep pace with contemporary research methods.<br></br>The three year curriculum begins with World History in the sophomore year and continues with U.S. History in the junior year. The senior seminar classes are a culmination of those two years of survey coursework. They are intended to offer students an array of topic options in both Modern World and U.S. History, inspired by teacher interest, that foster a semester long intensive study. Despite differing content, the senior courses are united in the common skills taught, practiced, and assessed.<br></br>*Please note that all courses are listed in order of <b>availabilty to the advancing grade levels.</b></p>
