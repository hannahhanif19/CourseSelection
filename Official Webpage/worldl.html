      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>In an increasingly interdependent world, communication and interaction with people in their own languages help build positive relationships. In addition to the practical benefits of speaking other languages, knowledge of another language encourages different ways of viewing the world we share. Community and business organizations name cross-cultural competency as a vital 21st century skill. LWHS is committed to fostering students’ proficiency in another language, as demonstrated by the depth of the curriculum and the length of study required—three years of study in one language or two years of study in each of two different languages. A level 4 or 4 Honors class is offered in all languages.
      <p>The culturally diverse faculty develop four basic language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) while exploring the cultural contributions of diverse regions united by a common language. Teachers use a dynamic approach that incorporates a broad array of materials, such as up-to-date texts and workbooks, classic and contemporary literature, films and shorts, documentaries, current events, internet sources, and music. Class activities (designed to address various learning styles) may include pair and small group work, games, student led classes, student presentations, skits and role plays, student made videos, research projects, internet based projects, and interaction and collaboration with community and international organizations.</p>
      <p>Recognizing that students progress at different rates, the department is sensitive to each student's unique needs and, when possible, offers accelerated or honors sections for students capable of a more demanding pace.<br></br>*Please note that all courses are listed in order of <b>language and levels of difficulty.</b><br></br>More info about the signing process is <a href="https://lwhs.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/200/download/download_2249521.pdf">here</a>.</p>
